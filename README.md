# gans-on-image-classification
This is a machine learning class project that applies GANs on the task of image classification. GAN is originally used for generating real-like images through the competing training of generator and discriminator. At here, after it is trained over many epochs, we use transfer learning and fine-tuning to adapt it into 10-way classification on MNIST dataset.
